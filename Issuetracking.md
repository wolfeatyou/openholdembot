# OpenHoldem issue tracking #

The OpenHoldem project uses an issue tracker as part of the quality management.

# Where to report #

Unfortunatelly we sometimes get problem reports by unknown people,
lacking necessary information, so we can't deal with them.
Therefore we appreciate, that you report problems in our forum,
where we can ask back, if we have further questions.
Please report your problems here: http://www.maxinmontreal.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=156    The developers will care about it and enter the issue to the issue-tracking-system,
as soon as the problem is verified and we have all necessary information.

# Information required #
  * software product and version
  * details about your setup: with/without stealth (e.g. bring), real casino or test environment (e.g. PokerAcademy or ManualMode), with/without hopper, pure formula or DLL/Perl
  * if possible exact steps to reproduce the problem (babysteps!)
  * additional data to understand or reproduce the problem: tablemap, replay-frames, screenshots, log-files.

We do very much appreciate, if you try to nail down the problem as much as possible,
i.e. you report a problem description, that is is reproducable singletabling without hopper and stealth in a test-environment like ManualMode or PokerAcademy.
Everything else is usually an issue with your setup.

**Thank you very much for your help!**
